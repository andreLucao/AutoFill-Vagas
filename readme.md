# Personal Info Autofill Extension

## About

This is a lightweight Chrome extension that helps you save and reuse your personal information **locally**, directly in your browser.

It was built to support people during their job-hunting journey.

Once you store your essential personal data, the extension can automatically fill out forms that require this information — saving you time when applying to jobs or creating accounts across dozens (or hundreds) of websites.

🔒 **Your data is stored locally and never leaves your machine.**
